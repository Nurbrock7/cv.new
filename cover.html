  <p class="cover">My name is Moegamat-Nur Brock. I am 23. I reside in Kensington,Cape Town. I am a very enthusiastic person. I love to interact within a team. I am a leader that leads with emphathy and compassion for the next person. I am a very hard worker that has a never give up attitude which sets me aside from the rest. I always seek to rise above and bring the best out of myself and the people around me.</p>

 
  <p class="cover">I see myself as an articulate, intelligent, professional individual with excellent communication and interaction skills, constantly exploring and implementing new processes to make things more efficient. I am extremely hard working with a high standard work ethic that is second to none. 
  </p>

  <p class="cover"> My strengths include motivating others, communication, ability to work under pressure and meet deadlines, flexible enough to adjust to a changing environment, interaction with people at all levels, patience, listening skills and attention to detail. </p>

  <p class="cover">I previousely said that I am a leader because I know the type of person that I am. I was on the RCL counsil on high school and the captain of my present football team. I coach and have  my own football team in my area for the disadvantaged kids to help them and even push them further to get scouted. I love being active. I have started an online course in Java via Udemy. I wanted to extend my knowledge on Java so that it can be implemented in my present course with Life Choices  </p>

  <p class="cover">With all been said, I wish to implement and passover all my skills and leadership within the company. I feel that I will be an asset to the company and gain vital experience.</p>
